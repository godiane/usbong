Usbong helps you create your own mobile applications to make your life and the lives of the people that matter to you more meaningful, more peaceful-- HAPPIER. =)

"Usbong" in Filipino is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can mean "a bud, a sprout, a shoot". As a verb, it means "to sprout, to grow, to develop". In Bisaya, it means "to burgeon, to grow, to expand, and to flourish."

For us (and hopefully for you too), "Usbong" also means an open-source platform that would allow people to create their own mobile applications by putting together components (like text inputs, checkboxes, radiobuttons, the camera, voice recorder, stop watches) and forming a tree using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

Context -> Tree -> Mobile Application

Right now, we are developing the Usbong platform at the Ateneo Innovation Center (AIC), but we would love to work with people from different parts of the world too.
