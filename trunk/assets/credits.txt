Usbong helps you create your own web-mobile systems to digitize and streamline processes, and make your life and the lives of the people that matter to you, more meaningful, more peaceful-- HAPPIER. =)

"Usbong" in Filipino is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can mean "a bud, a sprout, a shoot". As a verb, it means "to sprout, to grow, to develop". In Bisaya, it means "to burgeon, to grow, to expand, and to flourish."

For us (and hopefully for you too), "Usbong" also means an open-source platform that allows people to create their own web-mobile systems by putting together components (like text inputs, checkboxes, radiobuttons, the camera, voice recorder) and forming a "tree" using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Google Drive Spreadsheet. 

Context -> Tree -> Mobile + Web System

Right now, we are developing the Usbong platform with the Ateneo Innovation Center (AIC), along with government, academe, and industry partners, and we would love to work with people from different parts of the world too.
